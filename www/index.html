                <h1>Voynich's Happenings</h1>
                This is a *really* simple website to catalog certain happenings in the digital space.
                Each happening is accompanied with a few different articles or links for further research.
                Often, I'll try to link a thread on Reddit or Hacker News for some nice discussion on the topic.

                    <hr />
                        Reddit plans to charge money for using their API, many in the community believe
                        that this was an attempt to directly kill off third-party clients, such as Reddit is Fun and Apollo.
